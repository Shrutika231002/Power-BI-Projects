# Energy Consumption Analysis
Energy Consumption Anaylsis using Power BI provides an in-depth analysis of energy consumption and costs across multiple cities and energy types (Water, Electricity, and Gas) and a clear and actionable view of energy consumption trends, enabling better decision-making.
## Project Overview:
The project analyzes energy consumption patterns and costs across cities, tracking trends from 2016 to 2019 for electricity, water, and gas. It highlights cost variations by city and energy type, with a total cost of $15.84 million and 210 million units consumed. Visuals include city-wise cost distribution, a time-series analysis, and a donut chart showing electricity (88.49%), water (10.29%), and gas (1.21%) consumption. The interactive dashboard features city filters, year selection, and section navigation. Designed for usability, it has a dark theme with peach-coloured visuals and intuitive data visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and donut charts.
## Key Insights & Features of the Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard:
1.	Total Energy Cost & Consumption:
o	Total Cost: 15.84M
o	Total Units Consumed: 210M
o	Provides a quick overview of the overall energy expenses and usage.
2.	City-wise Energy Cost Trends:
o	The cost distribution among cities (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston) shows Chicago has a high total cost while New York experiences a cost decrease.
o	Helps identify regions with the highest and lowest energy expenditures.
3.	Energy Consumption Trends Over Time:
o	The time-series chart (2016-2019) shows a steady rise in energy costs, with fluctuations in electricity, gas, and water consumption.
o	Useful for identifying seasonal patterns or long-term consumption growth.
4.	Consumption by Type:
o	Electricity dominates energy consumption (88.49%), while water accounts for 10.29%, and gas is minimal at 1.21%.
o	This insight can drive decisions on resource allocation and efficiency improvements.
Key Features:
1.	Dark-Themed Visual Dashboard:
o	Enhances readability with a contrasting peach-colored text and graphs.
2.	City & Year Filters:
o	Dropdown menu for selecting specific cities.
o	Checkbox options to filter data by year (2016, 2017).
3.	Multiple Data Visualizations:
o	Bar Chart: Displays energy cost comparison across cities.
o	Time-Series Graph: Shows energy costs over time (2016-2019) for electricity, gas, and water.
o	Donut Chart: Visualizes the proportion of different energy types consumed.
4.	Navigation Panel:
o	Sidebar buttons for switching between Dashboard, Water, Electricity, and Gas sections for detailed analysis.
## Project Highlights:
Objective: Analyze energy consumption trends and cost variations across cities.
Scope: Tracks electricity, water, and gas consumption from 2016 to 2019.
Key Metrics: $15.84M total cost, 210M total units consumed.
City Focus: Highlights costs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Houston.
Data Insights: Time-series analysis of cost trends and a consumption breakdown (Electricity: 88.49%, Water: 10.29%, Gas: 1.21%).
Interactive Features: City filter, year selection, and section navigation.
Visual Design: Dark-themed dashboard with peach-colored fonts and intuitive data visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, and donut charts).
## Results:
✅ Energy costs have risen from 2016 to 2019 across all energy types.
✅ Water consumption dominates total usage, while electricity and gas play smaller roles.
✅ Buildings show even distribution of costs, suggesting balanced energy use.
✅ Interactive filters enable users to explore data by year, city, and energy type.
